			<p>As with most aspects of the doctoral program, defending and uploading your dissertation
		do not give you a roadmap back into civilian life. Directions and Doctoral
		Student are never part of the same utterance. People want to call you 'Dr.' and
		someone is perpetually asking, "Is it official, yet?"</p>
		<p>When the defense ends and everyone hangs up from the Zoom call, there are an
		array of texts pinging on your phone. You type quickly, "I think it went well." or
		"At least Dr. Dodds liked the found poems." Also, "Yes, there are revisions and
		I have to add a sixth chapter." Eventually the pinging ends and your husband is
		hugging you with the wine glasses in his hands. You toast, drink, and he buys
		you something from the internet. There have been gifts for each of the milestones.
		You needed them.</p>
		<p>Swearing to yourself and other cohort members that you would jump right on the edits
		after your defense now seems like a bad dream or a minor case of possession. Even though
		your chair took nice, simplified notes, even though you've written a couple hundred
		pages in academic writing, even though you wrote the literature review at least three 
		different times, your body freezes whenever you even catch the slight silvery glint of
		the MacBookPro. Each time you take the writerly pose and settle with your fresh cup
		of vanilla bean french press, your body starts slo-mo convulsions, a cold sweat appears
		across your forehead, and the smell of fear sinks you into a post-defense-paralysis.</p>
		<p>Each year, there are mythic tales told about previous cohorts. One girl went
		through two pregnancies and she still defended and uploaded on time. Someone fought
		off cancer. Others lived in their cars and finished the program. No tales exist of
		a student passing with a brilliant defense and then suffering from late-onset dysgraphia.</p>
		<p>Somehow you fight through the weeks (maybe months) of desolation and attack the
		edits head-on. It is not as bad as eating the cold spinach as a child that you stared 
		at for at least an hour. Some of the edits are fun. Finally, your chair is satisfied
		and she sends out the GS-13 from to your committee members. You upload to ProQuest
		and you wait for that final confirmation. Something more must happen. It is anti-climatic 
		to the degree that you don't post anything to your socials. You are left with the same 
		question that everyone at work has been asking, Is it official, yet></p>
