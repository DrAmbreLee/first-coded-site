 	<h1>Hello new world!</h1>
 	
 		<p>Uploading my dissertation to ProQuest, a monumental moment, was followed by a 
 		night of lesson planning and grading. Like any teacher USA, Sunday nights are a
 		mental parkour with emotions percolating faster than the morning coffee. First-
 		period-Monday-morning-high-schoolers need their teacher to BRING IT or stay home.
 		While it seems as if nothing has changed, in fact, there is a whole new world I 
 		get to explore as Dr. Lee. The path is foggy at the moment, but each day brings new
 		opportunities and possibilities. All I have to do is take another step.</p>
